                <h1>Why Software Engineering?</h1>
                <p id="left">My ambitious aspiration to pursue a career as a full-stack software
                    engineer
                    comes from being able to have an impact on people's lives while being able to continue developing my
                    problem-solving and analysis skills. The thought of contributing to the development of a program
                    that
                    helps and provides satisfaction to its users will make me proud. Knowing that the work I put into
                    the
                    program benefits individuals to enhance and make their experience easier is going to be super
                    rewarding
                    to other software engineers and myself. This industry is also full of complex technical challenges
                    that
                    will fulfill me when I am able to provide companies and consumers the necessary solutions to their
                    problems!

                <h1>Why Coding Temple?</h1>
                <p>I did a lot of research and spent a lot of time talking to people from Career
                    Karma before I committed to a bootcamp. Before committing to Coding Temple, I was researching every
                    bootcamp including Fullstack Academy, Coding Dojo, DevCode Camp, etc.. but I eventually committed
                    myself and the next 6 months of my life to Coding Temple.</p>

                    <h1>The Big Picture</h1>
                    <p>I believe no goal is too big to achieve, therefore I have set a lot of goals
                        for myself, some regarding my career while others are just personal goals. In this field, many
                        people
                        will probably end up having the same end goal, working for a big tech company. I am a part of
                        this
                        group of people. I want to be a part of a team of one of the companies I love the most, X
                        (formerly
                        known as Twitter), Spotify, or maybe even NASA. I know these companies are worth billions and
                        people
                        may be doubtful when a possible career for these companies is presented, but I will work every
                        day
                        to make sure I differentiate myself from others and constantly work on my code. Through Coding
                        Temple,
                        I will use their resources to the best of my ability. I will work to enhance my professional
                        knowledge, skills, and experience. I will be the best I can be. I am aware that it will take
                        time
                        and perseverance to reach my goal, but I am so dedicated! One day, I will be living in the city,
                        working as a full-stack developer for one of the companies I love the most knowing that all my
                        hard
                        work did pay off!</p>
