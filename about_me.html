                <h1>Autobiography</h1>
                <p>Hi! My name is Maria Rodriguez, although I prefer to be called "Meli'' (it is
                    short for Melissa, my middle name.) I was born on October 29th, 2002 making me 21 years old this
                    year
                    which I am so excited about. I was born, raised, and still residing in the awfully hot South Texas,
                    sadly I have made it one of my goals to move up North to a place with more pleasant and fair
                    weather.
                    I come from an extended Mexican family that shaped who I am today by constantly emphasizing the
                    importance
                    of family support, respect, hard work, and perseverance.</p>
                <br>
                <h1>Education and Work</h1>
                <p>The latest form of education I completed was my highschool education. I was
                    eligible
                    for a three-year graduation plan that allowed me to undertake my junior and senior courses during
                    the same year,
                    allowing me to graduate in 2020, a year earlier than expected! After high school, the idea of
                    continuing my education
                    was something I was always interested in, but unfortunately never pursued due to personal issues.
                    Throughout my gap
                    years, I started working in the retail industry where I was allowed to gain valuable experiences and
                    build character.
                    During this period, I was learning about myself and started setting goals for my future. This pushed
                    me to get into
                    introductory coding courses online where I learned the fundamentals about programming, discovered a
                    passion for this field,
                    and set my sights on pursuing a career as a full-stack software engineer!</p>
                <br>
                <h1>Hobbies and Interests</h1>
                <p>I enjoy a variety of things! My hobbies and interests are on a spectrum
                    ranging from watching reality
                    tv to learning about spirituality, just depending on my current mood.</p>
                <h2><i>Music</i></h2>
                <p>I adore music. I spend most of my day with music in the background. I listen
                    to it when I am getting
                    ready, working, doing chores, homework, anything. Music is so amazing, I love how people are able to
                    create a sense of emotion
                    just by using words and a melody. Below I have included some of my most listened to playlists
                    created by me! Feel free to
                    listen to them or even browse my account to find other playlists you might like!</p>

                <h2><i>Gaming</i></h2>
                <p>When I have completed everything on my to-do list, I turn on my computer to
                    play some video games.
                    I enjoy playing with friends, but don't mind playing solo. I am a very competitive player, for the
                    past years I have been
                    playing Valorant and was able to rank among the top 0.2% of players in the community! Below I have
                    included my gaming tiktok account with some of my best
                    gaming highlights!!!</p>

                <h2><i>Self-growth</i></h2>
                <p>This past year, I have really been dedicated to work on myself mentally and
                    physically. I contribute
                    to this by going to the gym, eating a healthy diet, and try my best to stay away from all the
                    negativity. Having this goal in
                    mind has truly helped me become a better person, I am able to say that I take care of myself. This
                    journey has helped me understand
                    a lot about who I am and I hope everyone can learn and try to be a better person for themselves as
                    well!</p>
